# Birthday Surprise Website

This is a playful single-page website originally created as a small birthday present. It features a countdown to September 13th and several interactive activities like playlists, quotes, quizzes and a click counter.

This revision modernises the look and adds a small photo gallery and festive confetti effects. The countdown automatically updates for the next September 13th each year. The layout is mobile friendly and uses Google Fonts for styling.

Open `index.html` in a web browser to try it out.
